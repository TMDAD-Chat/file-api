# File API

This application is intended to upload files into the Firebase storage and return the download link.

Among the storage options we had AWS S3, GCP Cloud Storage and Firebase Storage. 
We choose Firebase because it is basically GCP Cloud Storage with no credit card, it is easy implement, 
and it is cheaper on small scale.
